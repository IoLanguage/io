# Testing Summary for Io Language Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. IoFile.c (Line 1006-1007)
**Fix**: Store position value once to prevent double evaluation
- **Before**: Position argument could be evaluated twice with side effects
- **After**: Position is stored in variable `pos` at start of function
- **Test**: Compile test passed successfully

### 2. IoDynLib.c (Line 264-267) 
**Fix**: Free memory allocated for BLOCK trampoline code
- **Before**: Memory leak when marshalling BLOCK types
- **After**: Added `io_free((void *)n)` in demarshal for BLOCK case
- **Test**: Compile test passed successfully

### 3. IoMessage_parser.c (Lines 115-116, 227-228, 234-235)
**Fix**: Added proper error messages with line numbers
- **Before**: Empty TODO comments for error cases
- **After**: Implemented descriptive error messages with line numbers
- **Test**: Compile test passed successfully

### 4. run.io Test Runner (Line 9)
**Fix**: Use platform-independent path joining
- **Before**: Hard-coded "/" separator
- **After**: Uses `Path with()` for cross-platform compatibility
- **Test**: Syntax is valid Io code

## Compilation Status

Individual file compilation tests:
- ✅ IoFile.c - Compiles successfully
- ✅ IoDynLib.c - Compiles successfully  
- ✅ IoMessage_parser.c - Compiles successfully

## Build Issues

The full project build requires the parson JSON library dependency which was missing from the repository. A stub implementation was created to allow partial compilation testing.

## Recommendations

1. **Get Full Dependencies**: The project needs the actual parson library from https://github.com/kgabis/parson
2. **Run Full Test Suite**: Once built, run `io libs/iovm/tests/correctness/run.io`
3. **Memory Testing**: Run with valgrind to verify the memory leak fix in IoDynLib.c
4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test the path fix on Windows to ensure compatibility

## How to Test When Build is Available

```bash
# Build the project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run tests
./io ../libs/iovm/tests/correctness/run.io

# Test specific file operations
./io ../test_changes.io

# Memory leak testing (Linux/macOS)
valgrind --leak-check=full ./io [test_script]
```

## Code Quality

All changes:
- Are minimal and focused
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing code style
- Include appropriate error messages
- Fix actual bugs (not just cosmetic issues)
